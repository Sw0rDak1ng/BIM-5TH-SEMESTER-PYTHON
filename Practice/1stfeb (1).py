"""Note 1: We can pass a list, tuple or any collection object to a function.
eg: def myfunction(country):
     for x in country:
         print(x)
    country=['Nepal','India','China']
    myfunction(country)
note 2: Values can be returned by the function using "return" keyword.
eg: def square(n):
        return n**2
    print(square(5))
    or result=square(5)
        print(result)
note 3: More than 1 values can also be returned.
     eg: def check(n):
            return n,n*2
        --> returns as a tuple

--> Can be used as an alternate of loops.Implemented by using if...else.
Advatages:
1. Make the longer iterative programs simple and compact.

Disadvantages:
1. Consumes memory and takes more execution time."""
